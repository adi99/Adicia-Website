## Second Puzzle


<b> The Adicia team is building a Voxel based unique virtual world where players can play, own, and monetize content and gaming experiences. A Play To Earn (P2E) game similar to Minecraft or Sandbox but with an in-build Game Maker which will allow the Player to make complex games (puzzle and other genres) without any technical knowledge.</b> <br />
<b><i>User Generated Game Design and Monetization</i> is main focus of the this platform. Players are incentivised to not only Play-To-Earn (P2E), but also to build Games and Monetize them. We will have <i>A Metaverse game, A Game Maker</i> and <i>NFT Game MarketPlace</i> inside this Platform.</b><br/>

<b>Gamers are our main audience who will earn NFT by playing it, but also creators who will build complex NFT games with templates, scripts and Visual Editors.</b>

#### Web App 
Game with NFT Minting on Polygon Mainnet can be access at [Adicia Polygon](https://adicia-poly.netlify.app/) <br />
#### Video
This Puzzle's demonstration video is available at [Gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=St6gajbpMg8). Web3 Integration is not included in video because of time constraint.<br />

### Game Play
- Player will land on Metaverse  where he can explore the Open-World. <br />
- Player reached to the Optical Illusion Puzzle placed inside this World. <br/>
- Player will mint NFT after solving the Puzzle and move to next world.  <br/>
- Player reached to this next Environment (Medieval Interior) and explore this World. <br />
- Player will solve the next Mystery Physics Puzzle. <br />
- Player can mint their Second NFT and monetize both on NFT Marketplace. <br />

## Description of Levels 
This is a Voxel based puzzle game. The First Puzzle is based on optical Illusion similar to monument valley where user can manipulate impossible architecture and Second Puzzle is based on Physics (looking around, turning keys, and activating switches).This involve exploration of fantastic architecture and impossible geometry.

## Monument/Architecture Design
Inspired by minimalist 3D design, optical illusions and palaces and temples from around the world, every monument is a unique, hand-crafted world to explore. User can create NFTs using voxel based Monuments/Architecture. <br />
Twist and drag to reshape the world and help User to explore. Designed to be easy for everyone to pick up, enjoy and complete. <br />
Journeys through mazes of optical illusions and impossible objects, which are referred to as "sacred geometry" in-game, as she journeys to be forgiven for something.<br />
The game is presented in isometric view and the player interacts with the environment to find hidden passages as user progresses to the map's exit. <br />
Interactions include Twisting monuments, moving platforms and pillars, and creating bridges, moving ancient mechanics. <br />
Voxel based design make it easier to design the enviroment and architecture. 

## Mystery Physics Puzzle
It also has physics based puzzle similar to Room where the player with a series of strange puzzle boxes that feature a number of physical mechanisms. <br />
The player is challenged to figure out how to open each one – typically by undoing a series of locks – to access another puzzle box within it. <br />
The game uses a variety of motions enabled by mobile device touchscreens to simulate actions in real life, such as looking around the device, turning keys, and activating switches. 

# Future RoadMap

<b> 1- Adding More Levels:- </b> There are only two levels of GamePlay is available to Play. We need at least 20-25 levels of Gameplay to make it engaging for players to play. We also need soundtracks to be included in the Game. The following genre of Games are needed to be included in the Game:-
-  Optical Illusion 
-  Physics-Based Puzzle (Finding Clue, sliding Puzzle, Combination Puzzle, Match3, jigsaw 
-  Board game (Hitman Go) 
-  Point and Click game 
-  Card battle game 
-  City Builder (construct building, gather resources defense kingdom) 
-  Tower defence 
-  Turn-Based game 
-  RPG adventure
and many more genres of Games.  <br/>

<b> 2- Building Better Open World:- </b> This game needs a bigger Open world which can be explored during Gameplay. Interactive elements can be placed inside the Open world which makes them more immersive. <br/>

<b> 3- Better Integration of NFT:- </b> Players have a Open World which they can explore. Puzzles are placed inside the Open-World which when solved, move Players to next level of Metaverse(New World to explore). When Player Solved the Puzzle, they mint a NFT with HitPoints, AttackDamage and ShieldPoints. These NFTs can be Upgraded, bred, and battle with each other inside the Game. <br/>
Players can also purchase Virtual land and in-game Assets as NFTs and Use them as an assets to build any genre of Games. <br/>

<b> 4- Real-Time Card Battle System:- </b> Inside the Game NFTs can be minted, upgraded and bred. Players can play the Card battle with each other. Winner can earn NFTs and Points, which can be used to upgrade or bred(Combining two NFTs to mint new Powerful NFT).  <br/>

<b> 5- NFT and NFT Game MarketPlace:- </b> We need a Marketplace where Creators can buy, sell and trade NFTs, NFTs Games, Virtual Land, Open-world, and in-game Assets. Users can rate and review the NFTs, which will improve purchasing decision process and Sales. <br/>

## Build Voxel Game Maker (Needs 1.5-2 months to be completed)

This is the most difficult part of this Game Platform. Creators can use Assets and available scripts to build the Game.
- Templates of Open World and Puzzles will be available to customize according to Player's needs. They can also import Voxel Assets from any voxel editor or from the web and then use them to make the Open World of their Choice. They can sell them as NFT into MarketPlace and monetize them. <br />
- To build different types of Games, Scripts will be needed. For Players with no technical knowledge, there will be several Templates of different genres of Games with scripts, will be available for modification and combination. With these templates available inside the Game Maker, Players can Change the variable parameters of the script or Add multiple instances of same template/script to make complex Games. <br />
-Users can Combine different Templates/Script to make Innovative Games inside the Metaverse and monetize them into MarketPlace.
- <b><i>Visual Editor (similar to Unity Bolt)</i></b> for a game where User uses visual scripting like Powerful flow control graphs (similar to Unreal Blueprints) for low-level logic and complex tasks. Elegant finite state machines (FSM) for high-level logic and easy state management. Create and modify entire graphs while in Play mode.

<b><i> The Game-Maker will be a download-able native application (Mac, Windows, Linux). A web application can be created for building Mini Games but to make Big Game Native application needs to be downloaded. So we will have Web version of Game Maker for Mini Game and Desktop Apllication for Big Game. Players can Rate and Review these Games according to their Liking.</i></b> <br/>


## [NFT GAME MarketPlace](https://github.com/adi99/NFT_Market)
<b> The Rating and Review system needs to be added. It will take 10-15 days to finish it </b> <br />
1- The NFT Game Marketplace is an NFT marketplace where you can search and buy creator's ASSETS with Token to incorporate them into your Game. <br />
2- Creator can build game with different assets and templates and monetize them by listing in the MarketPlace. <br />
3- Creator can list both the Assets and Game in the NFT Marketplace and Monetize them according to their Ratings.<br />
4- The Game in the NFT Marketpalce can be organized according to their Ratings and Reviews.
